README!

This is a simple git repository where I create a project to replicate Google's homepage, to demonstrate and test my skills on the following points - 

1) Two ways to move a div around on the page
2) Stick a div onto the bottom or top of the page
3) Identify the background color of an existing webpage
4) Grab the URL for an image from an existing webpage
5) Center an element horizontally
6) Identify three ways you can include your CSS styles in a page
Understand how to use classes and ids to target CSS at specific elements on the page
7) Build a very basic form (even if it doesn’t “go” anywhere)
